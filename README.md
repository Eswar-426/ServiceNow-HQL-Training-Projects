| **Day 1**     | **Introduction to ServiceNow and ITSM**                  | \* **What is ServiceNow?** A cloud-based platform for digital workflows, often described as a No-code/Low-code platform. \* **Modules:** Incident, Problem, Change, Request, Asset, Configuration Management (CMDB), Knowledge Management, Service Catalog, ITSM, ITOM, ITBM. \* **ITSM Managements:** Understanding and distinguishing between **Incident Management** (restoring service quickly), **Problem Management** (finding and fixing root causes), and **Change Management** (managing system changes safely). \* **Admin Tasks:** Creating users and groups. |
| **Day 2**     | **Incident & Problem Management Tables**                 | \* Detailed breakdown of the default fields on the **Incident (`incident`)** and **Problem (`problem`)** tables, including their associated base tables (`Task[task]`) and field types (e.g., `String`, `Reference`, `Integer`). \* Fields covered include Number, Caller, Category, Subcategory, State, Impact, Urgency, Priority, and Assignment Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Day 3**     | **Update Sets and Table Creation**                       | \* **Update Sets:** The process for creating a new **Local Update Set** and setting it as the "Current" set to track configuration changes. \* **Table Creation:** Steps for creating new custom tables (e.g., `Course Master`, `Library Management`) by navigating to **System Definition \> Tables**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Day 4**     | **Table Replication and UI Policies**                    | \* **Table Creation:** Creating a custom table like the **Case Management System (CMS)**, often by replicating fields from the Incident table. \* **UI Policies:** Using UI Policies to control form fields dynamically. **Key actions include:** \* Making fields **Mandatory**, **Read-Only**, or **Visible/Hidden** based on conditions (e.g., if Category is 'Hardware', make Subcategory mandatory).                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Day 5**     | **Client Scripts (4 Types)**                             | \* Definition and usage of the four types of Client Scripts to add client-side (browser) logic: **`OnLoad`** (runs when the form loads), **`OnChange`** (runs when a specific field value changes), **`OnSubmit`** (runs when the user attempts to save/submit), and **`OnCellEdit`** (runs when a value is changed directly in a list view).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Day 6-8**   | **GlideRecord, Encoded Query, and Business Rules**       | \* **GlideRecord:** The fundamental API mechanism used to query, insert, update, or delete data from tables in server-side scripts (e.g., Background Scripts). \* **Encoded Query:** Using syntax to retrieve records based on specific conditions (e.g., `state=4^caller_id=Abraham Lincoln`). \* **Business Rules:** Understanding server-side logic that runs on database operations (**Before, After, Async, Display**). Examples include preventing record saves or displaying related information in a log/description based on conditions.                        |
| **Day 9**     | **Record Producers and Variable Sets**                   | \* **Record Producers (RP):** Providing a simplified, guided interface in the Service Catalog to create records in a backend table (e.g., Incident, CMS). \* **Variable Sets:** Creating reusable groups of variables to avoid recreating them for multiple Record Producers or Catalog Items. \* **RP Tasks:** Creating Record Producers for the **Incident Table**, a custom **COVID-19 Table**, and the **Case Management System (CMS) Table**.                                                                                                                       |
| **Day 10**    | **Catalog Client Scripts, UI Actions, and Process Flow** | \* **Catalog Client Scripts:** Applying client-side logic specifically to Catalog Items/Record Producers (e.g., `onLoad` to auto-populate an administrator's location, `onChange` to update location when the user changes). \* **UI Actions:** Creating buttons on the form (e.g., **"Assigned to me"**) that run server-side code to perform an action (e.g., setting the Assigned To field to the logged-in user). \* **Process Flow (Flow Bar):** Creating the visual step-by-step progress bar on a record form.                                                    |
| **Day 11**    | **Catalogs, Categories, and Workflows**                  | \* **Service Catalog Hierarchy:** Understanding the relationship between **Catalog**, **Category** (e.g., 'IT Gadgets'), and **Catalog Items** (e.g., 'IPhone16'). \* **Catalog Items:** Creating new items with associated variables and variable sets. \* **Workflows:** Creating a workflow for a catalog item, which defines the fulfillment process after a user submission.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Day 15/16** | **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**                      | \* **SLAs:** Creating and configuring Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the Incident table. \* **Key SLA Elements:** **Name** (e.g., P1, P2), **Table** (Incident), **Target** (Response or Resolution), **Duration** (e.g., 15 mins, 2 hours), **Start Condition** (e.g., State is New AND Priority is Critical), **Pause Condition** (e.g., State is On Hold), and **Stop Condition** (e.g., State is Closed/Resolved). \* **Schedule Creation:** Creating a custom schedule (e.g., 'Public Holidays') to exclude non-working hours from SLA calculations.           |
